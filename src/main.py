# Step-by-step process for setting up the project using Python 3 and a virtual environment on your MacBook Air M1:

# 1. Open Terminal in Visual Studio Code:
# You can open the terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking on Terminal in the top menu and then New Terminal.

# 2. Navigate to the project directory:
# Use the cd command to navigate to the project directory:
# cd <project_directory>

# 3. Create a virtual environment:
# You can create a virtual environment in your project directory using the following command:
# python3 -m venv venv
# This will create a new directory called "venv" in your project directory.

# 4. Activate the virtual environment:
# Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to activate it. 
# Activating a virtual environment will put the virtual environment-specific python and pip executables into your shell’s PATH.
# source venv/bin/activate
# Now, you're in the virtual environment, and you can install dependencies related to the project here which won't affect your global Python setup.

# 5. Install Python dependencies:
# The project's Python dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. 
# You can install these dependencies using pip:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# 6. Set environment variables:
# The project uses environment variables for configuration. 
# You need to set these environment variables in your terminal or add them to a .env file in the project directory. 
# The exact variables you need to set will depend on your project, but they may include things like database URLs, secret keys, and so on.

# 7. Run the project:
# Finally, you can run the project using the following command:
# python3 src/main.py

# 8. Deactivate the virtual environment:
# Once you are done with your work, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply typing deactivate in the terminal.

# Remember to replace <project_directory> with the actual path to your project directory.
